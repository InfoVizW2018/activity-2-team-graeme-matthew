<h1>SENG 480D - Activity 2</h1>

<h2>Team Members:</h2>
Graeme Turney, Matthew Hodgson

<h3>Assumptions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Code exists the behind the scenes of the visualization that knows how many berths exist at each location.</li>
  <li>The system has functionality to know the length of time it takes to get to each location from another, and set the length of time of the route accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What-Why-How:</h3>

<p><b>What</b></p>
<p>The current data is a set of tables. The attributes of the tables are the arrival and departure times from a pair of locatinos. The tables are itemized by the ferry name.</p>
<p><b>Why</b></p>
<p>Why does this visualization need to exist? So that it can present to the user the time schedules of multiple ferries on multiple routes. Users also wish to query the current schedule, to compare routes to one another.</p>
<p><b>How</b></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Design Study Methodology:</h3>

<h3>Pitfalls:</h3>

<p>Some of the pitfalls that may occur when designing this visualizations could be as follows:</p>

<p><b>PF-9: No need for change: existing tools are good enough.</b> There is an abundance of scheduling applications that currently exist. It is possible that a scheduling application could be adapted to fit the use case of Seaspan.</p>

<p><b>PF-: </b> </p>
