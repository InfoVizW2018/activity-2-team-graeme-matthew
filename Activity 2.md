<h1>SENG 480D - Activity 2</h1>

<h2>Team Members:</h2>
Graeme Turney, Matthew Hodgson

<h3>Assumptions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Code exists the behind the scenes of the visualization that knows how many berths exist at each location.</li>
  <li>The system has functionality to know the length of time it takes to get to each location from another, and set the length of time of the route accordingly.</li>
  <li>The time it takes for the ferry to move from one location is fixed per route.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What-Why-How:</h3>

<p><b>What</b></p>
<p>The current data is a set of tables. The attributes of the tables are the arrival and departure times from a pair of locatinos. The tables are itemized by the ferry name.</p>
<p><b>Why</b></p>
<p>Why does this visualization need to exist? So that it can present to the user the time schedules of multiple ferries on multiple routes. Users also wish to query the current schedule, to compare routes to one another.</p>
<p><b>How</b></p>
<p>The data is encoded through an ordered arrangement of different colours to signify a ferry's place in time, and the location it is travelling to and from. This data would be able to be manipulated through drag and drop functionality. It would allow you to adjust the arrangment by selecting a ferry and moving it the correct time. Clicking on it would also allow you to change the start and end location.</p>

<h3>Design Study Methodology:</h3>

<p>Due to the expidited nature of this activity, most of the 9 steps of the design were sped through or even skipped. Most time was spent on the design process after quickly learning about the problem at hand.</p>
<p>If given a larger amount of time to work on this problem, more steps of the process could be performed.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls:</h3>

<p>Some of the pitfalls that may occur when designing this visualizations could be as follows:</p>

<p><b>PF-9: No need for change: existing tools are good enough.</b> There is an abundance of scheduling applications that currently exist. It is possible that a scheduling application could be adapted to fit the use case of Seaspan.</p>
